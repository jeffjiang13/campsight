# What is Campsight and Why did we make it

CampSight is a camping application that uses a combination of technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The backend of the application is powered by Python and the FastAPI web framework. The application also uses mongoDB for its database, which is a NoSQL database. Our parks-api also makes use of the NPS (National Park Service) Data API to allow users to find the parks they are looking for. The application also use Galvanize's JWTDown for FastAPI module for user authentication.

On the front-end, the application is built using JavaScript and the React framework. This allows for a responsive and interactive user interface that makes it easy for users to search and find national parks. The application also integrates with the Google Maps API, which allows users to view maps of the local area around the parks as well as see where parks fall over the United States and its territories.

In addition to the search and map features, the application also allows users to favorite and rate the camps they have visited. This allows other users to easily see which camps are the most popular and make informed decisions about visting certain parks. Overall, CampSight is a powerful and user-friendly camping application that makes it easy for users to find and explore national parks.

## Our approach

Our intial approach to the website was based on our wireframe design. We built the layout of the front-end portion of our application in react first, using the wireframe for a guide. We then went into fastAPI and created endpoints to filter and provide data about different parks, allow users to login and recieve an authentication token, and allow authenticated users to leave reviews and favorite parks.
