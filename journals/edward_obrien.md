* Solidified stand-up and stand-down times and goals. Got our branches setup as well as the base code for the project so everyone is on the same page. Assigned issues for our main application features for each team member to begin writing up. Ran into an issue with our Campground Detail API that it wasn't returning results properly. After doing research on other possible API's, we found that one of the parameters was documented incorrectly. Began laying out the issue for my current task of the advanced search page.
